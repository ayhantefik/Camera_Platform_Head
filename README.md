<h1>A Camera Platform Controller operated by Head Gestures, equipped with an ESP32-CAM</h1>

This project showcases a camera platform controller operated by head gestures. The gestures are detected by a Nano33 BLE and the camera platform is equipped with an ESP32-CAM. The camera module captures live video and streams it through a custom socket server, which relays the feed to a Flask web application.
